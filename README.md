A better markdown (for me at least)

* a single way to do everything
* link syntax that isn't confusing (perhaps `<link http://google.com/ This is
  google>` or something like that)
* `/italics/` and `*bold*` instead of `*italics*` and `**bold**`
* comes with a good plugin system 
* and a reasonable set of plugins for typography etc.
* and for those who want things like `<del>`, `<abbr>`, `<u>` etc.
